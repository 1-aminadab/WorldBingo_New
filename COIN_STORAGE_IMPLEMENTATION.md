# Coin Storage Implementation Summary

## Overview
Implemented a comprehensive local storage system for user coin balances with per-user data isolation.

## Changes Made

### 1. Created CoinStorageManager (`src/utils/coinStorage.ts`)
A new utility class that manages coin balances per user in AsyncStorage:

**Features:**
- **User-specific storage keys**: `coins_${userId}` or `coins_GUEST`
- **Methods:**
  - `getCoins(userId)` - Get balance for a user (defaults to 0 for new users)
  - `setCoins(amount, userId)` - Set balance for a user
  - `addCoins(amount, userId)` - Add coins to balance
  - `deductCoins(amount, userId)` - Deduct coins (with validation)
  - `clearAllCoins()` - Clear all coin data (for testing)
  - `getAllBalances()` - Get all user balances (for admin/debugging)

### 2. Updated AuthStore (`src/store/authStore.ts`)

**Removed:**
- Hardcoded default of 1000 coins

**Added:**
- `loadCoins()` - Async method to load coins from storage
- Import and integration with `CoinStorageManager`

**Updated:**
- `userCoins` default changed from `1000` to `0` (will be loaded from storage)
- `setCoins()` - Now saves to storage via CoinStorageManager
- `deductCoins()` - Now saves to storage after deduction
- `addCoins()` - Now saves to storage after addition
- `initializeAuth()` - Now async, loads coins on app startup
- `login()` - Loads coins after successful login
- `verifyOtp()` - Loads coins after OTP verification
- `register()` - Loads coins after registration
- `loginAsGuest()` - Now async, loads coins for guest user
- `convertGuestToUser()` - Loads coins after guest conversion

### 3. Updated Auth Hooks & Screens

**useFirebaseAuth (`src/hooks/useFirebaseAuth.ts`):**
- Made `initializeAuth` call async
- Wrapped in async function to await initialization

**LoginScreen (`src/screens/auth/LoginScreen.tsx`):**
- Updated `handleGuestLogin` to async
- Awaits `loginAsGuest()` call

### 4. How It Works

#### First Time User:
1. User registers/logs in for the first time
2. `CoinStorageManager.getCoins(userId)` returns `0` (new user)
3. Balance initialized to `0` in storage
4. User needs to purchase coins to play

#### Existing User:
1. User logs in
2. `loadCoins()` called after authentication
3. `CoinStorageManager.getCoins(userId)` retrieves saved balance
4. Balance restored in authStore

#### Guest User:
1. Guest logs in
2. `loadCoins()` called with undefined userId
3. Storage key: `coins_GUEST`
4. Balance maintained separately from authenticated users

#### Multiple Users:
1. Each user has their own coin balance
2. User A: `coins_12345` â†’ Balance: X
3. User B: `coins_67890` â†’ Balance: Y
4. Guest: `coins_GUEST` â†’ Balance: Z
5. Complete data isolation per user

### 5. Coin Balance Display

**ProfileScreen:**
- Already uses `userCoins` from `useAuthStore`
- Automatically displays balance from local storage
- Updates in real-time when coins change

**TransactionReport:**
- Will show transaction history (already implemented)
- Each transaction linked to userId
- Filtered by current user

### 6. Transaction Integration

When coins are added/deducted:
1. Transaction occurs (game start, purchase, etc.)
2. `deductCoins()` or `addCoins()` called
3. Balance updated in memory AND storage simultaneously
4. Both Zustand store and AsyncStorage stay in sync

### 7. Data Flow

```
App Start
  â†“
initializeAuth() called
  â†“
loadCoins() called
  â†“
CoinStorageManager.getCoins(userId)
  â†“
AsyncStorage retrieval
  â†“
Balance set in authStore
  â†“
UI displays current balance

Transaction Occurs
  â†“
deductCoins(amount) / addCoins(amount)
  â†“
Update authStore.userCoins
  â†“
CoinStorageManager.setCoins(newBalance, userId)
  â†“
AsyncStorage updated
  â†“
UI updates automatically (Zustand reactivity)
```

### 8. Storage Keys Structure

```
AsyncStorage:
â”œâ”€â”€ coins_GUEST          â†’ Guest user balance
â”œâ”€â”€ coins_12345          â†’ User ID 12345 balance
â”œâ”€â”€ coins_67890          â†’ User ID 67890 balance
â”œâ”€â”€ game_reports_GUEST   â†’ Guest game reports
â”œâ”€â”€ game_reports_12345   â†’ User 12345 game reports
â”œâ”€â”€ cash_reports_GUEST   â†’ Guest cash reports
â””â”€â”€ cash_reports_12345   â†’ User 12345 cash reports
```

### 9. Testing Scenarios

1. **New User Registration:**
   - Register â†’ Balance = 0
   - Purchase coins â†’ Balance updates
   - Close app â†’ Reopen â†’ Balance persists

2. **Existing User Login:**
   - Login â†’ Balance loaded from storage
   - Play games â†’ Balance deducted
   - Close app â†’ Reopen â†’ Balance persists

3. **Guest User:**
   - Login as guest â†’ Guest balance loaded
   - Play games â†’ Guest balance updated
   - Convert to registered user â†’ Balance transferred

4. **Multiple Users on Same Device:**
   - User A logs in â†’ Sees User A balance
   - User A logs out
   - User B logs in â†’ Sees User B balance
   - Complete isolation

### 10. Migration from Old System

**Before:**
- All users started with 1000 coins (hardcoded)
- Balance not persisted properly
- No user-specific storage

**After:**
- New users start with 0 coins (realistic)
- Balance persisted in AsyncStorage
- User-specific storage keys
- Existing users: Balance will be loaded from Zustand persistence (if any), then saved to new system

## Files Modified

1. âœ… `src/utils/coinStorage.ts` (NEW)
2. âœ… `src/store/authStore.ts`
3. âœ… `src/hooks/useFirebaseAuth.ts`
4. âœ… `src/screens/auth/LoginScreen.tsx`

## Files Already Working

- âœ… `src/screens/ProfileScreen.tsx` (uses `userCoins` from store)
- âœ… `src/screens/reports/TransactionReport.tsx` (filters by userId)
- âœ… `src/screens/reports/GameReport.tsx` (filters by userId)
- âœ… `src/utils/reportStorage.ts` (user-specific report storage)

## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

1. **Coin Purchase Integration:**
   - When user completes payment
   - Call `addCoins(purchasedAmount)`
   - Balance updates automatically

2. **Admin Panel:**
   - Use `CoinStorageManager.getAllBalances()` to view all user balances
   - Useful for debugging and support

3. **Analytics:**
   - Track coin usage patterns
   - Monitor purchase behavior
   - Identify low-balance users for promotions

4. **Backup/Restore:**
   - Export user's coin balance for backup
   - Restore from backup if needed

## Benefits

âœ… **User Privacy:** Each user's coins are stored separately
âœ… **Data Persistence:** Coins survive app restarts
âœ… **Offline First:** No network required to read/update balance
âœ… **Scalability:** Works for unlimited users on same device
âœ… **Debugging:** Easy to inspect via `getAllBalances()`
âœ… **Clean Code:** Centralized coin management logic
âœ… **Type Safe:** Full TypeScript support
âœ… **Real-time:** UI updates immediately on balance changes

## Conclusion

The coin storage system is now fully implemented with:
- Per-user storage isolation
- Persistent local storage
- Dynamic balance loading
- Automatic UI updates
- Complete data privacy

No more hardcoded defaults - everything is dynamic from local storage! ðŸŽ‰
